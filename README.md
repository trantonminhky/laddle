# Laddle - Because Wordle is not enough
Laddle (a portmanteau of Ladder and Wordle) is a word game inheriting both functionalities from Word Ladder and Wordle. You are given a source word, and through hints you must ladder your way to the answer.

Each of your guesses should only differ by one letter at a time. Upon confirming your row, the row tiles may either be highlighted green, yellow, or none at all. When highlighted green, it means the answer contains the letter in the tile and at the correct position. When highlighted yellow, it means the answer contains the letter in the tile, but not at that position. No highlight means that letter does not exist in the answer.
